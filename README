Summary
====================

A network scanning tool for sending fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets.

Description
====================

synfrag is a network scanning and penetration testing tool used to craft and
send fragmented and unfragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. It currently supports
sending both TCP SYN, ICMP echo (ping), and ICMP6 echo packets. Various
fragmentation configurations are also available. synfrag tries its best to
read any replies sent by targeted hosts to determine if they are willing
or able to respond.

The purpose of synfrag is to test host and network responses to fragmented
requests. Many current routers implement access control lists (ACLs) in
a manner that is unable to properly detect traffic inside fragmented IP
packets, leading to situations where hosts are believed to be isolated from
internet traffic by these ACLs. In some cases, specially crafted packets can
bypass these router ACLs by taking advantage of their inability to properly
process fragmented packets, exposing hosts to the internet unprotected.

Some operating systems implement a security mechanism that ignores fragmented
TCP SYN packets, preventing connections from being established under
the assumption that these packets are abnormal and specially designed to
circumvent network protections.  However, many of these operating systems
do not implement the same protections for all protocols, allowing some
fragmented traffic through while blocking others.

Notes
====================

synfrag is currently under development and is missing some useful features.
Namely, synfrag does not resolve hostnames nor discover the next-hop layer
2 address, and requires the user to specify these parameters.

Additionally, synfrag does not attempt to prevent the host operating system
from interpreting any replies received from scanned hosts, meaning that after
a scan the operating system may send a TCP RST packet to the scanned host,
misinterpreting its reply as meant for the operating system. This can be
worked around via firewall rules.

TCP SYN requests sent by synfrag currently all use the source port 44128. The
same number is used for ICMP/6 echo packet IDs. When writing firewall rules
to prevent the operating system from misinterpreting replies or to prevent
synfrag scans, traffic sent to (or from) this port, or with this ICMP echo ID,
can be discarded.
